## Voluntary carbon market 
COO2 DAO a voluntary carbon credit offset issuer and carbon-credit value chain that supports the scaling up of the voluntary carbon market.
Carbon credits are certificates representing quantities of greenhouse gases that have been kept out of the air or removed from it. 

## Why ? 
Carbon credits can help companies and the world meet ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
We are here to strengthen voluntary carbon markets and support climate action on a large scale and confront the climate challenge.

Many businesses cannot fully eliminate or lessen their emissions quickly. The challenge for organizations that aim to achieve net-zero emissions, which means removing as much greenhouse gas from the air as they put into it. It's becoming necessary to use carbon credits to offset emissions organizations can’t get rid of by other means. Purchasing carbon credits is one way for an organization to address emissions it is unable to eliminate. 

## Pledging help 
Stop climate change by reducing your greenhouse gas emissions. 

The market for voluntarily carbon credits (rather than for compliance purposes) is important for many reasons. 
Voluntary carbon credits direct private financing to climate action projects that can have additional benefits such as:
- biodiversity protection
- pollution prevention
- public-health improvements
- job creation. 
Carbon credits also support investment into the innovation required to lower the cost of emerging climate technologies. 

## Significant growth of voluntary market for carbon credits
Voluntary carbon markets facilitate the mobilization of capital with the most potential for economical nature-based emissions-reduction projects.

Today’s voluntary carbon market lacks the liquidity necessary for efficient trading, in part because carbon credits are highly heterogeneous. Each credit has attributes associated with the underlying project, such as the type of project or the region where it was carried out. These attributes affect the price of the credit, because buyers value additional attributes differently. Overall, the inconsistency among credits means that matching an individual buyer with a corresponding supplier is a time-consuming and inefficient process usually transacted over the counter.

### Matching 
The matching of buyers and suppliers in trustless way. 
#### Efficient 
All credits are described through common quality features and additional attributes of carbon credit.
#### Core carbon principles
Quality criteria provides a basis for verifying that carbon credits represent genuine emissions reductions.
#### Common taxonomy  
Standard attributes in a common taxonomy help sellers to market credits and buyers to find credits that meet their needs.
#### Core contracts
Make bids for credits that meet criteria in a core contracts combined with reference attributes.

### Trading infrastructure
Flexible infrastructure enables the voluntary carbon market to function effectively
- Accommodate high-volume listing and trading of reference contracts, 
- Contracts reflecting a limited, consistently defined set of additional attributes. 
- Support the creation of structured finance products for project developers.

### Post-tradeing infrastructure
 Comprising of validators and meta-registries.
 Validators support the development of a futures market and provide counterparty default protection. 
 Meta-registry provide non-custodian services for buyers and suppliers and enable the creation of standardized issuance numbers for individual projects. 

### Data infrastructure 
- Transparency of reference and market data. 
- Always available data for all environmental and capital markets. 
- Track on blockchain 
- reporting services
- analytics services 
- openly accessible reference data through smart contracts 

### Carbon credits usage
Companies reduce their emissions with option to offset emissions and benefit from clear guidance on what constitutes an environmentally sound offsetting program in overall push toward net-zero emission, help ensure that carbon offsetting does not preclude other efforts to mitigate emissions and does result in more carbon reductions.

### Establish a need
 - Company discloses greenhouse-gas emissions from all operations
 - Company discloses targets for reducing emissions
 - Company discloses plans for reducing emissions over time and compensate for emissions from sources that can be eliminated
 - Company can **purchase** and **retire** carbon credits 
 Claim the reductions as their own and take the credits off the market, so that others can’t claim the same reductions. 
 Use carbon credits to neutralize the so-called residual emissions that it wouldn’t be able to eliminate in the future.

## Demand signal transmission
Effective way for buyers of carbon credits to signal their future demand encourage project developers to increase the supply of carbon credits. Long-term demand signals arrive in the form of commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions or as up-front agreements with project developers to buy carbon credits from future projects. Medium-term demand is be recorded in a registry of commitments to purchase carbon credits.

Consumer-oriented carbon credits.
